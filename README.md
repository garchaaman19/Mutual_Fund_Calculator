A Mutual Fund History & Calculator app made with Flask and React. Currently it supports only Axis Mutual Fund, but with next release I will be adding options for more fund houses.
Users can view history of all schemes/funds of Axis AMC.
Users can also calculate the number of returns they would have recieved if had they invested.

## Installation
cd in flask_backend and then run pip -r requirements.txt
cd in react/mutual_fund to install the package.json files.

### How to run 
You need to start the backend server by running comman *python main.py runserver*
Then you need to start the react app by npm start command.

#### Instructions 
You will be able to search only for funds after April 2015, the app is still under development phase, suggestions/bux fixes are welcomed.
